=========================================================================



2. OVERVIEW

The Base TRD is an embedded video processing application designed to showcase
various features and capabilities of Zynq Z-7020 All Programmable SoC (AP SoC)
device for the embedded domain. The Base TRD consists of two elements: The
Zynq-7000 AP SoC Processing System (PS) and a video processing pipeline
implemented in Programmable Logic (PL). The AP SoC allows the user to implement
a video processing algorithm that performs edge detection on an image (Sobel
filter) either as a software program running on the Zynq-7000 AP SoC PS or as
a hardware accelerator inside the PL.

The Base TRD demonstrates how the user can seamlessly switch between a software
or a hardware implementation and evaluate the cost and benefit of each
implementation. The TRD also demonstrates the value of offloading computation
intensive tasks onto PL, thereby freeing the CPU resources to be available for
user-specific applications.

The package consists of two video based application projects which differ
in user interface.
a) video_qt application has a graphical user interface designed
using QT framework.
b) video_cmd application has a command line based menu where the user can
navigate the menu by typing options into the terminal.

For information on how to use this package, along with build instructions,
please refer http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Zynq+Base+TRD+2015.4

3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Software:
  -- Vivado Design Suite 2015.4
  -- Proper installation of required license files for the TRD.
  -- Optional: ZC702 board uses CP210x USB to UART Bridge to provide COM port
     connection to the board. This configuration is highly recommended because
     the UART outputs information to hyper terminal right after power up.
     To use this feature, hyper terminal, Minicom, teraterm or equivalent
     terminal software on the host machine is required. For details, please
     refer to UG925 for USB-to-UART Bridge driver installation.
  -- For additional information on software installation, refer to UG798.

Hardware:
  -- The reference design targets the Zynq ZC702 evaluation board, Rev C or
     above.
  -- ZC702 evaluation board setup in the default configuration as documented
     in the Default Switch and Jumper Setting of UG850.
  -- AC power adapter (12VDC)
  -- HDMI-to-HDMI or HDMI-to-DVI cable (depending on available Monitor)
  -- Monitor capable of supporting 1080p60 / 720p60
  -- USB Type-A Female to USB Micro-B Male cable
  -- USB hub
  -- USB mouse
  -- Optional: USB Type A Male to USB Mini-B Male cable if using USB-to-UART
     bridge
  -- Optional: Avnet FMC IMAGEON daughter card for video input with 1080p / 720p
     input video source
  -- SD memory card reader for transferring files onto the SD card.
     (not included in the package)

5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS


ZC702 Initial Setup:
--------------------

-- All jumpers and switches should be in default setting except SW16.
   Mode switch SW16 should be set to boot from SD card.
   See image for SD boot in User Guide (UG925).
   For a board with SW16, use the following configuration
   1: GND
   2: GND
   3: VCC
   4: VCC
   5: GND
   J21, J20, J22, J25, J26: Unstuffed
   For Rev C version of the board which does not have SW16,
   use the following jumper settings:
   J21: 2-3
   J20: 2-3
   J22: 1-2
   J25: 1-2
   J26: 2-3
-- Connect one end of the HDMI cable to board HDMI connector, connect the other
   end to the monitor's HDMI or DVI input
-- Connect USB Micro-B cable to on-board USB Micro connector J1, then connect up
   USB hub, mouse and keyboard.
-- connect the AC power adapter
-- Optional: If USB-to-UART bridge is used, connect USB Mini-B side of USB-to-
   Mini-B cable to the on-board mini USB connector (J17). Connect USB side to
   the control PC.
-- Optional: If Avnet Imageon card is used, connect the card to FMC slot 2.
   Connect 1080p/720p video input source to HDMI-IN.

Building Design:
----------------

Instructions to Build Hardware and Software for this TRD are available at
http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Zynq+Base+TRD+2015.4

The pre compiled files are kept in ready_to_test directory and can be loaded on SD card
root to get started with the design. On Linux boot up the TRD application is
auto loaded and GUI comes on the screen. Here various options can be explored.

For more details on how to Run the TRD please see UG925,User Guide.

6.OTHER INFORMATION

1) Design Notes
	Not applicable.

2) Known Issues
	Mouse hotplugging is not supported in Video QT application.
	Hence it is must to connect mouse before starting application.
	Reason: Qt 5 has a hard dependency on libudev for hot pluggable hardware detection/support.
